# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game
A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation in Java that generates random X and O placements on a 3x3 grid.
Features

Random Grid Generation: Automatically fills a 3x3 grid with random X's and O's
Console Display: Clean grid output showing the game board
Win Detection: Checks for winning combinations across rows (horizontal wins)
Simple & Lightweight: Pure Java console application with no external dependencies

# How it Works
The application creates a 3x3 character array and randomly populates each position with either 'X' or 'O'. The grid is then displayed in the console, and the program checks for any winning rows.
Sample Output
x o x 
o x o 
x x o 

Row 2 has three x's!
